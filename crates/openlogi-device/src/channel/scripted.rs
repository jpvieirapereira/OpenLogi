//! A scripted HID++ transport for tests: it answers requests from a per-device
//! responder instead of talking to hardware.
//!
//! Shared because more than one module needs a device with a feature table of
//! its choosing — `write` drives DPI and lighting against one, `host_switch`
//! needs a keyboard whose host slots it can dictate. Each module keeps its own
//! responder; only the plumbing lives here.
