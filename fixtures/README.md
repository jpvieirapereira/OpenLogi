# OpenLogi fixture corpus

This directory is the repository-level home for future reviewed, sanitized
captures produced by `openlogi fixture record`. One physical specimen owns one
directory:

```text
fixtures/devices/<synthetic-specimen-id>/
  manifest.json
  profile.json
  cases/
    <operation>.json
```

Only privacy-verified fixture assets belong here. Never commit native recorder
output, host paths, original hardware identities, passkeys, or unsanitized
temporary files. Run `openlogi fixture verify <fixture-directory>` before
review.

The small built-in synthetic profile is packaging data rather than captured
corpus. It stays under
`crates/openlogi-fixture/fixtures/devices/openlogi-canonical-synthetic-001/` so
the published `openlogi-fixture` crate and mock agent remain self-contained.
It intentionally declares no recorded cases or hardware provenance.
