# OpenLogi fixture corpus

This directory is the repository-level home for future reviewed, sanitized
captures produced by `openlogi fixture record`. One physical specimen owns one
directory:

```text
fixtures/devices/<synthetic-specimen-id>/
  manifest.json
  profile.json
  cases/
    <operation>.json
```

Only privacy-verified fixture assets belong here. Never commit native recorder
output, host paths, original hardware identities, passkeys, or unsanitized
temporary files. Run `openlogi fixture verify <fixture-directory>` before
review.

## Contribute a device fixture

Use the contribution wizard instead of writing `manifest.json`, synthetic
identities, case relationships, or occurrence counts by hand:

```sh
openlogi fixture contribute \
  --id mx-master-3s-001 \
  --name "MX Master 3S" \
  --device "MX Master 3S" \
  --output fixtures/devices/mx-master-3s-001
```

The first run talks only to the running Agent and writes a privacy-safe semantic
profile plus resumable state. It then asks you to stop the Agent and rerun the
same command. The second run uses the CLI's own HID permission to capture all
eight supported read-only operations, self-replays them, generates the exact
identity ledger and case relationships, and runs strict on-disk verification.
Nothing is uploaded automatically.

Use `--profile-only` when direct HID access is unavailable. Standalone raw-HID
devices automatically produce profile-only fixtures because the cassette
format covers HID++, not raw device writes. A profile-only contribution is
still useful for the mock Agent and desktop tests.

Keep the same physical device connected between both runs. On macOS the Agent
and CLI are separate Input Monitoring identities, so permission granted to one
does not grant it to the other. The wizard deliberately does not add raw
recording to Agent IPC.

The small built-in synthetic profile is packaging data rather than captured
corpus. It stays under
`crates/openlogi-fixture/fixtures/devices/openlogi-canonical-synthetic-001/` so
the published `openlogi-fixture` crate and mock agent remain self-contained.
It intentionally declares no recorded cases or hardware provenance.
